# DADAnalyse
DADAnalyse is a module to process, analyze, and visualize voltage data from .DADA files. It handles data loading, processing (e.g., cross-power spectra, visibilities), and various diagnostic plots, including antenna power spectra. 

## Caution
The code is currently being tested on DADA files of the format TAFTP 

I would like to thank Colin Clark and Matthew Bailes for their valuable contributions to the code.
